1. Convert .rst to .org.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   pandoc python.rst -o python.org
   #+END_EXAMPLE
2. Fix the image links (only 2 in the file) to allow export to HTML.
   - Replace links like =[[img/py/foo.png]]= to =[[file:./img/py/foo.png]]=.
     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     sed -r -i.bkp 's;\[(img/py/.*\.png);[file:./\1;' python.org
     #+END_SRC
3. =C-c C-e h h= (in emacs) to export to HTML.
   - The =ox-twbs= package renders HTML with a really good-looking CSS (Twitter Bootstrap). If you have that installed in emacs, run =C-c C-e w h=.
4. I do not have the latex /needspace/ package installed, so the latex converter complained on lines containing =\Needspace=. So I deleted all of those.
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   sed -r -i.bkp2 ';/\\[nN]eedspace/d' python.org
   #+END_SRC
5. =C-c C-e l p= (in emacs) to export to PDF.
